#How to name components in client
Start with a capital letter: React components should be named with a capital letter as it indicates that it's a component and not a regular HTML element. For example, Button instead of button.

Use camelCase: Components should be named using camelCase, which means that the first letter of each word is in lowercase except for the first word. For example, myComponent instead of my_component.

Be descriptive: The name of the component should be descriptive, and it should indicate the purpose of the component. For example, LoginForm instead of Form.

Use a prefix: A prefix can be used to indicate the type of component, such as UI for presentational components and Container for container components. For example, UIButton instead of Button.

Avoid using generic names: Generic names such as Component or Container should be avoided as they don't indicate the purpose of the component and make it harder to understand the codebase.
